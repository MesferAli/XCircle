# How to Prepare for ZATCA E-Invoicing Phase 2: A Complete Guide for Saudi Businesses

*Published: January 15, 2026 | 8 min read*
*By Ahmed Al-Rashid, Head of Product at [Company]*

## Saudi Arabia's E-Invoicing Revolution Is Accelerating

With over 600,000 businesses now in the integration pipeline, ZATCA's
Fatoorah e-invoicing system represents one of the most ambitious digital
tax initiatives in the GCC. As Phase 2 waves continue to expand, businesses
with annual revenues as low as SAR 5 million are now receiving integration
notifications from ZATCA.

Non-compliance isn't just a technical inconvenience — penalties range from
SAR 5,000 to SAR 50,000 per violation, and repeated failures can result
in business suspension.

**Key takeaway**: This guide walks you through the technical requirements,
integration steps, and best practices to achieve full ZATCA compliance
before your deadline.

## Why Phase 2 Is Different from Phase 1

Phase 1 (the Generation Phase) required businesses to simply generate
invoices in a standardized electronic format. Many businesses met this
requirement with basic accounting software updates.

Phase 2 (the Integration Phase) is fundamentally different. It requires:
- **Real-time API integration** with ZATCA's Fatoorah platform
- **Cryptographic stamping** of each invoice
- **QR code generation** with embedded tax data
- **UUID assignment** for unique invoice identification
- **XML format** compliance (UBL 2.1 standard)

This means your ERP or accounting system must be capable of communicating
directly with ZATCA's servers — in real time.
