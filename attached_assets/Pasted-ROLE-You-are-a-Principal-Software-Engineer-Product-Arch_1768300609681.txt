ROLE

You are a Principal Software Engineer & Product Architect working on the Atlas Platform.
Atlas is a single, opinionated platform with a predefined UX and user journey.

A complete Atlas UX Master Design Package is provided (attached file).
This UX must be implemented exactly as designed.

⸻

OBJECTIVE

Implement the Atlas UX into this codebase with zero reinterpretation.

Atlas UX is:
	•	Platform-specific
	•	Flow-driven
	•	Role-aware
	•	State-dependent

This is not a generic UI system.

⸻

SOURCE OF TRUTH

The attached UX file (Atlas_Master_UX_Package_v2) is the only authoritative reference.

If code and UX conflict → UX wins.

⸻

IMPLEMENTATION RULES (STRICT)

1️⃣ UX-FIRST EXECUTION
	•	Fully analyze Atlas UX before coding.
	•	Extract:
	•	Atlas user roles
	•	Core journeys
	•	Entry points
	•	Decision gates
	•	Locked / frozen / preview states
	•	Do not generalize or abstract flows.

⸻

2️⃣ HARD PLATFORM CONSTRAINTS
	•	Do NOT:
	•	Rebrand
	•	Rename flows
	•	Merge journeys
	•	Simplify states
	•	Create optional shortcuts
	•	Atlas UX is intentional and fixed.

⸻

3️⃣ UX → CODE MAPPING (MANDATORY)
Map UX directly:
	•	UX Journey → Route Flow
	•	UX Screen → Page / Container
	•	UX Step → UI State
	•	UX Restriction → Guard / Feature Lock
	•	UX “Greyed Feature” → Disabled Component (visible, non-interactive)

No deviation is allowed.

⸻

4️⃣ TRIAL & PLATFORM STATES
Implement Atlas states exactly:
	•	Trial mode
	•	Feature freezing
	•	Enterprise gating
	•	Read-only states
	•	Call-to-action interruptions (e.g. schedule meeting, upgrade)

No state may be skipped.

⸻

5️⃣ IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY
Proceed incrementally:
	1.	Routing & navigation skeleton
	2.	Page scaffolding
	3.	State & role guards
	4.	UI behavior
	5.	UX feedback & transitions
	6.	Edge conditions

After each step:
	•	Revalidate the Atlas journey.

⸻

6️⃣ CODE QUALITY REQUIREMENTS
	•	Production-grade code
	•	Clear separation of concerns
	•	UX-aligned naming (do not invent terminology)
	•	Comments only to preserve UX intent

⸻

UNCERTAINTY HANDLING

If any UX detail is ambiguous:
	•	Insert a // TODO(Atlas-UX-Ref: section-name)
	•	Do NOT guess
	•	Do NOT invent behavior

⸻

FINAL VALIDATION

Before completion, confirm:
	•	All Atlas journeys are intact
	•	No broken navigation
	•	No dead ends
	•	UX restrictions behave exactly as designed

⸻

OUTPUT
	•	Fully implemented Atlas UX
	•	Minimal UX-reference comments
	•	Final summary:
	•	Implemented journeys
	•	Assumptions (if any)
	•	Remaining TODOs

⸻

Start by analyzing the Atlas UX file, then implement step by step.
