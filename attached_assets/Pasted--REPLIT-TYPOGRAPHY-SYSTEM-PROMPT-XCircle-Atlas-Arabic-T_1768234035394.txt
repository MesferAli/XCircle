🔤 REPLIT — TYPOGRAPHY SYSTEM PROMPT

XCircle Atlas | Arabic Typeface Integration (Enterprise-Grade)

⸻

🔴 OPERATING MODE (STRICT)

You are NOT changing:
	•	Backend logic
	•	Product behavior
	•	Security or governance
	•	Page structure or flows

You are implementing Typography only.

If you:
	•	apply the Arabic font everywhere blindly
	•	reduce readability
	•	alter numeric alignment
	•	break RTL layouts

👉 THE TASK IS FAILED.

⸻

🎯 OBJECTIVE

Implement a professional Arabic typography system that:
	•	Uses the provided Arabic font as a Brand Typeface
	•	Preserves maximum readability for enterprise users
	•	Works seamlessly with White Mode + RTL
	•	Maintains a calm, trustworthy executive look

⸻

🧠 TYPOGRAPHY STRATEGY (MANDATORY)

1️⃣ Font Roles (DO NOT MIX RANDOMLY)

A) Brand / Display Typeface
Use the provided Arabic font ONLY for:
	•	Hero titles (H1, H2)
	•	Section headers
	•	Page titles
	•	Recommendation titles
	•	Key callout phrases

Purpose: Identity, distinction, confidence

⸻

B) Functional Text Typeface
Use a highly readable Arabic Sans font for:
	•	Body text
	•	Paragraphs
	•	Forms
	•	Tooltips
	•	Audit logs
	•	Tables
	•	Long explanations

Purpose: Readability, comfort, clarity

(If unsure, pick a clean Arabic sans that supports RTL well.)

⸻

C) Numbers & Technical Data
Use a neutral Latin font (e.g. Inter / Roboto) for:
	•	Numbers
	•	Percentages
	•	Dates
	•	IDs
	•	Correlation IDs
	•	Logs

Purpose: Precision and alignment

⸻

📐 FONT SIZING & HIERARCHY (GUIDELINE)

Element	Font	Size	Weight
Hero Title (H1)	Arabic Brand Font	Large	Semi-Bold
Section Title (H2)	Arabic Brand Font	Medium	Medium
Page Title (H3)	Arabic Brand Font	Regular	Medium
Body Text	Arabic Sans	Regular	Regular
Helper Text	Arabic Sans	Small	Regular
Numbers	Latin Font	Regular	Regular


⸻

🧩 RTL & LAYOUT SAFETY RULES
	•	Text direction must be rtl for Arabic UI
	•	Icons must mirror correctly
	•	Spacing must rely on padding, not alignment hacks
	•	Numbers remain LTR inside RTL containers

⸻

🎨 WHITE MODE COMPATIBILITY
	•	Ensure sufficient contrast
	•	Avoid light font weights on white backgrounds
	•	Test:
	•	Dashboard
	•	Recommendations
	•	Recommendation Details
	•	Audit Log

⸻

🚫 EXPLICITLY FORBIDDEN
	•	Using the Arabic brand font for long paragraphs
	•	Applying one font globally
	•	Mixing Arabic numerals styles inconsistently
	•	Breaking table alignment
	•	Decorative typography

⸻

📦 DELIVERABLES

Replit must deliver:
	1.	Arabic brand font loaded correctly
	2.	Typography roles implemented as:
	•	CSS variables / theme tokens
	3.	Clear separation:
	•	Display font
	•	Functional font
	•	Numeric font
	4.	Screenshots showing:
	•	Hero section
	•	Recommendations
	•	Audit log
	5.	Written confirmation:
“Typography updated only. No logic or layout behavior changed.”

⸻

❌ FAILURE CONDITIONS
	•	Reduced readability
	•	Font applied incorrectly
	•	RTL broken
	•	Numbers misaligned
	•	Inconsistent hierarchy

⸻

🟢 SUCCESS DEFINITION

The task is successful ONLY if:

An executive can read the interface comfortably for 30 minutes
Without fatigue
And immediately feel a distinct Arabic enterprise identity
