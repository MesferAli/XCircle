Build Production-Grade Enterprise AI Layer (NO DEMO, NO MOCKS)

⸻

🔥 OPERATING MODE (READ CAREFULLY)

You are NOT building a demo, prototype, PoC, or UI showcase.

You are building a PRODUCTION-GRADE ENTERPRISE PLATFORM intended to be deployed in regulated government / enterprise environments.

If you return:
	•	mock logic
	•	seed-only data
	•	in-memory storage
	•	fake AI
	•	UI without real backend enforcement

👉 THE TASK IS FAILED.

⸻

1️⃣ ABSOLUTE NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES

1.1 No Demo / No Mock / No In-Memory
	•	❌ No seed data in production mode
	•	❌ No in-memory storage
	•	❌ No placeholder AI logic
	•	❌ No fake recommendations

✅ Must use persistent database (PostgreSQL or equivalent)

⸻

1.2 AI MUST BE REAL, DETERMINISTIC, EXPLAINABLE
	•	No black box
	•	No random outputs
	•	No “if qty < X then recommend”

Each recommendation MUST include:
	•	confidence_score (0–100)
	•	signals_used (list)
	•	time_window
	•	deterministic logic

If this is missing → FAIL

⸻

1.3 NO AUTO-EXECUTION — EVER
	•	Posting = HARD DISABLED
	•	Actions = Draft only
	•	Approval mandatory
	•	Dry-run mandatory

This must be enforced in:
	•	backend
	•	policy engine
	•	UI

⸻

1.4 REST-FIRST (NO VENDOR ASSUMPTIONS)

Assume ALL CUSTOMERS USE GENERIC REST APIs ONLY.

Oracle / Zoho / ERPNext are optional later.

If your design depends on any ERP → FAIL

⸻

1.5 AUDIT TRACE IS LEGALLY REQUIRED

For every recommendation:

Signal
→ Mapping
→ Canonical Model
→ AI Decision
→ Policy Check
→ Human Approval
→ Draft Action

This trace MUST be queryable in UI.

No trace → FAIL

⸻

2️⃣ PLATFORM DEFINITION (DO NOT REINTERPRET)

You are building:

Enterprise AI Layer
A decision-intelligence platform that sits ABOVE systems, not inside them.

This platform:
	•	ingests data via REST APIs
	•	normalizes to a canonical model
	•	runs deterministic AI
	•	proposes decisions
	•	enforces governance
	•	NEVER executes automatically

⸻

3️⃣ REQUIRED CORE MODULES (ALL MANDATORY)

You MUST implement ALL of the following as real backend modules:

3.1 Generic REST Connector (REAL)
	•	Persistent connector configs
	•	Auth support:
	•	API Key
	•	Bearer
	•	OAuth2
	•	Polling with cursor/time window
	•	Rate limiting
	•	Health checks

No UI-only connectors.

⸻

3.2 Zero-Code Mapping Engine (REAL)
	•	JSONPath → Canonical
	•	Stored mappings in DB
	•	Validation
	•	Preview
	•	Versioning
	•	Rollback

Mapping must actually transform real REST payloads.

⸻

3.3 Canonical Inventory Model (STRICT)

Entities:
	•	Item
	•	Location
	•	StockBalance
	•	StockMovement
	•	DemandSignal
	•	Recommendation
	•	Anomaly
	•	Action

AI services must ONLY consume canonical entities.

⸻

3.4 Capability Discovery Engine (AUTOMATED)
	•	Probe REST endpoints
	•	Detect:
	•	read capability
	•	draft action capability
	•	No manual toggles
	•	Store results in DB
	•	Use to enable/disable use-cases

⸻

3.5 REAL AI Inventory Engine

Implement deterministic algorithms for:
	•	demand forecasting
	•	stockout risk (7/14/30)
	•	anomaly detection

Each output must include:
	•	confidence_score
	•	explanation
	•	signals_used

No random, no LLM.

⸻

3.6 Policy Engine (HARD ENFORCEMENT)
	•	Who can approve
	•	What action types allowed
	•	Environment awareness (DEV/UAT/PROD)
	•	Instant revoke

Policies must be enforced server-side.

⸻

3.7 REST Action Guardrails (MANDATORY)
	•	Read-only default
	•	Draft only
	•	Dry-run required
	•	Approval required
	•	Blast-radius limits

Backend must reject violations even if UI is bypassed.

⸻

3.8 Audit Engine (IMMUTABLE)
	•	Store every signal
	•	Store every decision
	•	Store every policy evaluation
	•	Store every approval
	•	Store every outbound action

No deletes. No edits.

⸻

4️⃣ UI REQUIREMENTS (SECONDARY BUT REQUIRED)

UI is NOT the product, but must expose:
	•	Dashboard (real metrics)
	•	Connectors (real configs)
	•	Mapping Studio (real transformations)
	•	Capabilities (auto-discovered)
	•	Recommendations (real AI)
	•	Policies (hard-coded guardrails visible)
	•	Audit (full trace viewer)

Add GLOBAL BANNER:

🔒 Production Mode — No auto-execution. All actions require approval.

⸻

5️⃣ STORAGE & INFRA (MANDATORY)
	•	PostgreSQL (or equivalent)
	•	Proper schema
	•	Tenant isolation
	•	Secrets vault (env-based minimum)

No SQLite.
No memory DB.

⸻

6️⃣ DELIVERY RULES

You MUST deliver:
	•	Real backend code
	•	Real database schema
	•	No mocks
	•	No TODOs
	•	Clear README
	•	OpenAPI spec
	•	Audit proof

If something is “future work” → explicitly mark it disabled.

⸻

7️⃣ FAILURE CONDITIONS (ANY = TASK FAILED)
	•	Seed data used in PROD
	•	In-memory logic
	•	Fake AI
	•	No confidence score
	•	No audit trace
	•	UI pretending backend exists
	•	Auto-execution possible

⸻

8️⃣ SUCCESS DEFINITION

This task is ONLY successful if:

A government CISO can audit the platform
A COO can trust the decisions
A system can be unplugged instantly
No engineer is needed per customer

⸻

🔚 END OF PROMPT — NO QUESTIONS, JUST BUILD

🎯 نصيحتي الصريحة لك (خارج البرومبت)
	•	البرومبت هذا قاسي لكنه ضروري
‏	•	Replit يميل دائمًا لبناء “App”
	•	هذا البرومبت يجبره يبني Platform
