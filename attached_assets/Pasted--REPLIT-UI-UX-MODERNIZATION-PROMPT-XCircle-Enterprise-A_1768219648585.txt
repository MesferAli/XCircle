🎨 REPLIT — UI/UX MODERNIZATION PROMPT

XCircle Enterprise AI Layer — White Mode UI Refresh

⸻

🔴 OPERATING MODE (STRICT)

You are NOT changing backend logic.
You are NOT adding features.
You are NOT modifying security, policies, AI, connectors, or workflows.

You are performing UI/UX modernization ONLY.

If you:
	•	touch backend logic
	•	change API contracts
	•	alter data flow
	•	weaken governance banners
	•	introduce demo-only shortcuts

👉 THE TASK IS FAILED.

⸻

🎯 OBJECTIVE

Modernize the existing UI only to achieve:
	•	Clean White Mode default
	•	Enterprise / Government-ready look
	•	Visual alignment with XCircle brand
	•	Clear, calm, executive-friendly interface

⸻

🧠 BRAND GUIDELINES (XCIRCLE)

	4.	Recommendations
	•	Card/list layout
	•	Confidence clearly visible
	•	Status badges (Draft / Blocked)
	5.	Recommendation Details

	•	Signals used grouped and readable
	•	No dense blocks of text
	6.	Policies & Guardrails

	•	Calm but firm tone
	7.	Audit Log

⸻

🎨 DESIGN RULES (MANDATORY)
	•	White background by default
	•	Subtle borders & dividers
	•	Spacing over lines
	•	Minimal icons (functional only)

	•	Changing labels meaning
	•	Removing governance banners
	•	Over-design / marketing visuals

⸻

📦 DELIVERABLES

Replit must deliver:
	1.	Updated UI with White Mode default
	2.	Visual consistency across all pages
	3.	Screenshots:
	•	Dashboard
	•	Recommendations
	•	Recommendation Details
	•	Audit
	4.	Written confirmation:
“UI changes only. No backend, security, or logic changes were made.”

⸻

❌ FAILURE CONDITIONS
	•	Any backend change detected
	•	Governance banners removed or softened
	•	UI looks like demo/marketing site
	•	Dark mode enabled by default

⸻

🟢 SUCCESS DEFINITION

The task is successful ONLY if:

A CIO can open the platform
Feel immediate trust
Clearly read decisions and explanations
And perceive the product as Enterprise-grade
